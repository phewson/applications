## Your task

This material is provided as context to the problem. You should rewrite it as you see fit.  IN particular, you should demonstrate you understand why we are undertaking a cluster analysis, and what the various methods are telling us.  In particular, you should explain how principal components helps us visualise the results of the clustering.


## The Problem

Police recorded data in Great Britain is called "Stats19" and is available at <https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-accidents-safety-data>.  These data are typically split into three linked tables:

- Accidents

  Each row represents a single reported accident. Key fields include:

  - Date and time
  - Location (e.g. latitude/longitude, local authority)
  - Road type and conditions
  - Weather and lighting
  - Number of vehicles and casualties

- Vehicles

  Each row represents a vehicle involved in an accident. Includes:

  - Vehicle type and age
  - Manoeuvre and direction
  - Driver age and sex

- Casualties
  
  Each row represents a person injured or killed. Includes:

  - Casualty type (pedestrian, cyclist, driver, etc.)
  - Severity (slight, serious, fatal)
  - Age, sex, and mode of transport

These tables are linked via a unique accident index.


We are interested in creating clusters of like authorities based on the kinds of collisions that occur in their area.  You have been given a count of the number of collisions at Mini-roundabout, in the Rain, in the Dark, when the road is Dry, in an urban setting and where the most seriously injured casualty was reported as having a slight injury.

Some previous cluster analysis work has been reported at:

- [ Cluster analysis](https://ijirt.org/publishedpaper/IJIRT175966_PAPER.pdf)
- [More cluster analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357727987_Identification_of_Traffic_Accident_Patterns_via_Cluster_Analysis_and_Test_Scenario_Development_for_Autonomous_Vehicles/fulltext/61dcdc17034dda1b9eebd63d/Identification-of-Traffic-Accident-Patterns-via-Cluster-Analysis-and-Test-Scenario-Development-for-Autonomous-Vehicles.pdf)


## The Data

The first thing we can do is consider a scatterplot of the data

![](../../data_cache/vignettes/unsupervised_classification/scatterplot.html){width="100%" height="600px"}

We are going to use the proportion of each subtype of collision that was reported, and rescale the variables.


## Hierarchical clustering


The first task is to perform hierarchical clustering.

![](../../data_cache/vignettes/unsupervised_classification/dendrogram.html){width="100%" height="600px"}


You need to select a suitable ``cut-point'' and cut the tree at an appropriate height to form a number of clusters.

To aid visualisation of results, you should plot the cluster membership on a scatterplot of the first two principal components.


![](../../data_cache/vignettes/unsupervised_classification/kscatter.html){width="100%" height="600px"}


## kmeans clustering


The second task is to perform k-means clustering. You should select an appropriate number of clusters.
First, you should look at the cluster centroids:


![](../../data_cache/vignettes/unsupervised_classification/kcentroids1.html){width="100%" height="600px"}


![](../../data_cache/vignettes/unsupervised_classification/kcentroids2.html){width="100%" height="600px"}


As before you should plot the cluster membership on a scatterplot of the first two principal components.

![](../../data_cache/vignettes/unsupervised_classification/kscatter.html){width="100%" height="600px"}





##  Additional credit

For additional credit you should consider adding a further unsupervised classification method. Alternatively, you could increase the number of variables used in the clustering.

Instructions: You can use this document to record when, how and why you used GenAI to complete your assessment. It will help you create a record of AI use to submit alongside your references for AI-integrated and AI-assisted assignments. It may also be useful to help you discuss your AI use if you are required to do so in an academic conduct meeting.
